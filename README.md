# DSA Practice Repository  

This repository contains my **practice problems** while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++**.  

## Why This Repository Exists  
I created this repository to:  
- Track my **progress** and motivate myself to improve my problem-solving skills.  
- Build a **strong foundation in DSA**, which is essential for real-world software development.  
- Practice writing **clean, efficient, and correct code** in C++.  
- Keep a **record of my solutions**, so I can revisit concepts anytime.  

## Structure  
- Problems are organized in folders by topic (e.g., `Linked List/`, `Stack & Queue/`, `Trees/`, `Graph`).  
- Each file contains solutions to questions related to that topic.  

## Purpose  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills and logical skills.  
- Solve a variety of problems across different data structures and difficulty levels.  
- Prepare for coding interviews, contests, and practice for future projects.  

## Note 
- This repository is meant for **learning and practicing questions**, and is not a full-fledged project.  
- These are supplemented with practice on LeetCode problem sets along with weekly and bi-weekly contests side-by-side, to strengthen my competitive skills and be exposed to problems without a standard problem statement.
